🐼 What is Pandas?
The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.
Pandas is a powerful open-source Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides two main data structures:
Series: 1D labeled array
DataFrame: 2D labeled table (like Excel)
💡 Built on top of NumPy, often used with Jupyter, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
